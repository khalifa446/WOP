    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Scientific study of behavior & mental processes</h3>
        <p>Psychology uses empirical research and observation to understand thoughts, emotions, and actions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Internal mental processes</h3>
        <p>Explores memory, perception, language, learning, problem-solving, and decision making.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Human experience & self-growth</h3>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origins and Evolution of Psychology</h2>
    <p>Psychology’s roots trace back to ancient civilizations, where questions about the soul, consciousness, and behavior were raised by philosophers in Egypt, Greece, India, China, and Persia. Greek philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle pondered the nature of mind and human behavior. In India, Buddhist psychology introduced ideas about perception and consciousness. Islamic scholars such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna wrote extensively about mental health and emotional functioning, centuries before psychology emerged in the West.</p>

    <p>The term "psychology" comes from the Greek words "psyche" (soul) and "logos" (study). However, psychology did not become a distinct scientific discipline until Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental psychology lab in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. Wundt aimed to analyze the structure of the mind using introspection, laying the foundation for structuralism. As psychology progressed, it evolved through various schools of thought, each expanding its scope and methodology.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The 14 Branches of Psychology</h2>
    <p>As the field matured, psychology was divided into 14 major branches to specialize research and application. This division allows psychologists to focus on specific dimensions of mental processes and behavior. These branches emerged over time in response to societal needs, scientific advancement, and philosophical exploration.</p>
    <p><strong>Why this division?</strong> As psychology grew during the 20th century, no single method or theory could explain the full range of human thoughts and behaviors. Thus, it became essential to organize the discipline into focused subfields — each with its own methods, applications, and research goals. This allowed psychology to be applied in medicine, education, industry, law, technology, and beyond.</p>
    <p><strong>When did this happen?</strong> The division into branches began primarily in the early to mid-20th century. As the demand for psychological expertise expanded — especially after the World Wars — universities, research institutions, and governments began recognizing the need for specialized psychological services in different domains.</p>
